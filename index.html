							<h2>Early age</h2>
							<p>Born on June 28 1971,Pretoria,South Africa. Every since the age of 10 Elon has had an interest in computers. He used this as an escape from his parents broken relationship. As his mother and father where not getting along leading to a divorce in the family just when Musk was 10-12 years old.Working with the low tech he had at age 12, he programmed his own game called Blastar.  Click the button below the play! The game is very simple and shows that everyone starts out with the basics and works their way up.
								Once he made blastar he then sold it for 500$ using his amazing marketing skills that he learned when he was younger. You can see how he is able to use them today in many of the products that he creates. He has to sell them to others that don't understand technology. A key skill that every single tech worker needs to have. Try and learn a skill outside of programming to better yourself for the job market.

							<h2>Elon's College life to First company. </h2>
							<p>At age 17 he moved to Canada to attend a University to avoid the military service in South Africa. Musk would use his Canadian citizenship he gained to easily obtain an American citizenship. Three years latter he left Canada to study 
								physics and business at U-Penn. After graduation he attended Stanford for two days trying to pursue a PhD in energy physics. The reason he was there for two days was because of the famous dot com crash during his college days.
								The Dot Com crash is when the every growing tech industry hit a economic wall with the market being over saturated. Musk knew that he was not going to be able to pay for college. Balancing the odds he knew that he had to drop out. 
								This thought comes across the minds of many college students, but be careful. Musk had already graduated and had past experience in the field. This does not jusitify the need to drop out like many other CEOs of big companies today. Stick it out and learn all that you can!
